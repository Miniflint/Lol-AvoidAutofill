# Lol-AvoidAutofill
NoMore Autofill In LoL

What the script do is :
1. record 2 of your mouse position
2. save them in a file
3. read the file
4. send the input to LoL client
5. wait between 35 - 60 second before "reseting" the matchmaking


You will take around 3-4 more minutes to find a game, but you'll have your role for sure !

enjoy having your role. F12 to pause the script, and F10 to uninstall it
